# matrixOperationsCLI
A small command line interface to quickly do the three basic matrix operations on a matrix:
  - multiplying a row by a scalar
  - interchanging two rows
  - adding a row multiplied by a scalar to another row

This was made as a small tool to learn with. I Originally made the operations without the client.

The idea is to experiment and mess with the matrix easily witout having to do all
multiplications and additions, so one can focus on doing the right operations.
